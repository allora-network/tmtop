# tmtop Configuration File
# 
# This is an example configuration file for tmtop, a terminal-based monitoring tool
# for Tendermint/CometBFT consensus visualization.
#
# Place this file at ~/.config/tmtop/config.toml to use it by default,
# or specify a custom location with --config-file flag.
#
# All settings in this file can be overridden by command-line flags.
# Environment variables are also supported with TMTOP_ prefix (e.g., TMTOP_RPC_HOST).
